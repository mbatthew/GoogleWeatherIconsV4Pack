The weather icons bundled with this application are sourced from:
- Source: https://github.com/mrdarrengriffin/google-weather-icons
- Original Rights Holder: Google LLC (according to source repository)

**Critical Legal Information:**
1. The source repository explicitly states: "I do not own these icons. All rights belong to Google"
2. No official Google documentation has been located confirming these specific icons are released under any open source license
3. The Google Maps Weather Icons documentation (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/weather/weather-condition-icons) does not specify licensing terms
4. These icons may be subject to Google's standard copyright protection

**User Responsibility:**
- Users and distributors of this application assume full responsibility for compliance with applicable copyright laws
- This application is distributed under the premise of fair use for interoperability purposes
- Commercial use or redistribution may require separate licensing from Google LLC
- Users should seek legal counsel if uncertain about their intended use

**Recommendation:**
For applications requiring clear licensing compliance (such as F-Droid distribution), consider using alternative weather icon sets with explicit open source licenses.
